As an experienced Systems Analyst, combined with Sysadmin skills on UNIX/LINUX/VMware/Oracle systems among others.
Acting in recent years and having the privilege of working in the best companies in Brazil such as:
(Public Security Department, Claro/Embratel, IBM, IRB, Light, Petrobras), I was able to apply

These recipes together with my knowledge and willingness to reach new horizons and acquire new knowledge, I developed critical thinking and problem solving skills.
Thus, adding years of experience plus dedication, willpower and persistence, I decided to work in a new specialty, studying hard for more than 5 hours a day with Python, Django and Data Science development.

My credentials include an MBA in IT Project Management at the VINCIT Innovation Center - UNICIV, Graduated in information system at UERJ, an institution of higher education and advanced research, classified as one of the best and most prestigious schools in Brazil.
